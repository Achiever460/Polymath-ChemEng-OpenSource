# Polymath-ChemEng-OpenSource

## Description:

Polymath-ChemEng-OpenSource is an initiative to develop an open-source alternative to the proprietary Polymath software, tailored specifically for Chemical Engineering applications. The project aims to provide a free and accessible computational tool for solving a wide range of engineering problems, including process optimization, material design, and environmental sustainability.

## Features:

- Solving systems of linear equations.
- Performing linear regression analysis.
- Extensible architecture for future functionality expansion.
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- User-friendly interface optimized for Chemical Engineering workflows.
